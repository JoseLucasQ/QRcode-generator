# QR Code generator

a little side project i have been working on. Used a video to make the base of the project and i have been working to adequate the website to what is asked of the system

the ideia came from this repository
> https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/2-Intermediate/QRCode-Badge-App.md

and i Used the following video as base
>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiUlml9MDk

the video show how to do it with URLs, changing to text was not that hard, but it is still needed to make the text area better and formatted for the project specifications.

Also, i was going to change the code that make the qr code to the one from the repository, but the one in the repository dont have a option to select the size, so i will be sticking to the current code, just modifing in the future to format propely the text
